Title:
Stylo2gg: Visualizing Reproducible Stylometric Analysis

Abstract:
For researchers using R to do work in stylometry, the Stylo package in R is indispensible, but it also has some limitations. The Stylo2gg package addresses some of these limitations by extending the usefulness of Stylo. Among other things, Stylo2gg adds logging and replication of analyses, keeping necessary files and introducing a systematic way to reproduce past work. With visualization as its initial purpose, Stylo2gg also makes exploring stylometric data easy, providing options for labeling, highlighting subgroups, and double coding data for added legibility in black and white or in color. Finally, as hinted by the name, the conversion of graphics from base R into Ggplot2 changes the style of the output and introduces more options to extend analyses with many other packages and add-ons. The reproducible notebook shown here, `01-stylo2gg.qmd` or rendered in [`01-stylo2gg.html`](01-stylo2gg.html), walks through much of the package, including many features that were added in the past year.
